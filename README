GitDeploy is a set of PowerShell scripts which can clone one or more remote git repositories and ensure each repository is kept up to date.

It was designed for a distributed deployment enviornment where source code should be distributed to many servers in a scalable manner (each server maintains a local copy, and retreives by a pull mechanism).

It is designed to handle distributed configuration of itself too. There is an option to load lists of remote repositories through a variety of methods, even easily using a GitDeploy-pulled list of locations.

Requirements:
- Windows Powershell
- Git for Windows
